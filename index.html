            <h3>What is Health Coaching?</h3>
            <div class="hline"></div>
            <p class="text-white">
              Health coaching is a powerful tool for increasing accountability
              and helping you achieve your health goals. By working with a
              coach, you can develop the skills and strategies you need to stay
              on track and make progress towards a healthier and happier life.

              <h4>Emotional Eating</h4>
              <p>
                Emotional eating is a common issue with negative health
                repercussions. Health coaches assist by identifying triggers
                like stress, educating on healthy coping mechanisms, fostering
                self-awareness of emotional patterns, and offering emotional
                support to develop positive changes and provide affirmations.

            <div class="healthbox">
              <h4>Chronic Stress</h4>
              <p>
                Chronic stress can harm your health, but health coaching offers
                ways to manage it. Coaches identify triggers, create coping
                strategies, guide lifestyle changes, promote a positive mindset,
                and provide ongoing support for stress reduction. Health and
                wellness coaching can empower you to enhance your overall
                well-being by addressing chronic stress.

              <h4>Accountability</h4>
              <p>
                Health coaching significantly enhances accountability by
                clarifying goals, helping to creating action plans, offering
                regular check-ins, providing support and encouragement, and
                celebrating successes. With a coach's guidance, you can develop
                the skills and strategies necessary to achieve your health goals
                and maintain commitment to a healthier life.

              <h4>Weight Loss</h4>
              <p>
                Health coaching simplifies weight loss with personalization,
                expert guidance, behavior modification, education, and support
                for emotional well-being. We take a holistic approach,
                addressing overall health alongside weight loss. Remember, a
                coach complements medical advice, and consulting a healthcare
                professional is crucial for underlying health concerns.

              Hello, I'm Katherine Craig, and I've been where you might be right
              now. I used to feel like life was passing me by, dealing with
              chronic stress, disordered eating, and unhealthy food habits.
              Exercise was the last thing on my mind, and I was constantly
              anxious. My goal each day was simply to get through it. But today,
              I wake up with joy, excited about the day ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              My relationship with food is healthy, and I've overcome my eating
              disorder. Chronic stress is a thing of the past, and my
              perspective on life has completely transformed. I even enjoy
              exercising now, doing things I never thought I would, like
              long-distance running and weightlifting. So, remember, never say
              never!

          <h3>Testimonials</h3>
          <p>"This health coach Katherine is great to work with. Not only does she give you advice about workouts and healthy eating but she helps with stress management and figuring out what is causing a roadblock for you. She helps plan for ways to prevent certain stuff that may get in your way or get you off track with your workouts so that you stay motivated. I started out fully motivated and ready to go. I was working out on a regular with at least 5 to 6 workouts a week then I lost all motivation. There was a time when I went a week or so more and lost all interest in working out because of school and work being so overwhelming. Katherine never stopped working with me but instead continued to talk with me about how important it is to stay healthy. Every time I came up with an excuse she would come up with a logical reason of why I should get back to my workouts and how it would help make me feel better and ease the stress. For instance I would tell her how stressed I was about an exam that I had coming up and she would tell me, well if you workout then that will make you feel better about it because it'll help with your stress level. I quit using excuses and started working out again and she was right. She helps get down to the bottom of what is causing your problem and helping find a solution. I'm now back to working out and trying to make better choices in the foods that I eat. She has helped me out so much and also helps me look at the positive side of a lot of things"</p>

            "Katherine has been a total game changer for me.  From teaching me stress reduction and relaxation techniques to guiding me on how to feed my body and fuel my workouts.  She works with you to develop a plan that allows you to fit health and wellness into your daily lifestyle.  I have learned to make better food choices and how to utilize the right exercises to help me achieve my goals.  I feel better than I have in a long time and have learned the importance of making time for myself.  She was able to pinpoint problems in my health journey that I was unable to identify.  She quickly developed interventions that worked!  A complete joy to work with, I would recommend  her to anyone I know!!!!"</p>
